> MVC  : Model - View - Controller


Concept : To Split the implementation as per data model ; presentation layer ; and controller flows 

How it fits with Android ?

* In android an Activity manages layout + Business logic .

* Mvc makes an activity to set it's View (Layout) alone and makes it dependent on controller for model operations. 





> MVP  : Model - View - Presenter




> MVVM : Model  - View - ViewModel
